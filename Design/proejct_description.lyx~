\begin_layout Section
Target
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The target is to create an opensource, free, easy-to-extend software for
 non-life reserve calculations.
 The program should be easily extendable and modular.
 For example the addition of a new supported database (i.e Derby, MySQL etc.)
 should be independent of the avaiable estimation modules.
 This means that at compile time there is no knowledge over the database
 structure.
 On the other hand the estimation methods should have no knowledge about
 how or where they are saved, how the data is loaded etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Platform
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Java applications I know two options to build on: Netbeans RCP or Eclipse
 RCP.
 Netbeans RCP was chosen, because it builds on the standard Swing libraries,
 thus more platform independent than the SWT libraries in Eclipse RCP.
 Furthermode Maven is used as dependency management and build tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reach the desired level of flexibility the software is divided into separate
 modules.
 The aim of these modules is to provide a backbone for business functionalities
 by managing common tasks, such as database management, persistence or the
 project structure.
 These modules provide extension points for business functionalities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Database API
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module represents the database support for the application.
 the main role of this module is to create/delete databases and provide
 a connection string to the Persistence API.
 To create support for a new database (i,e, Derby, MySql) one just need
 to create an implementation for the
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\shape italic
org.jreserve.database.DatabaseProvider 
\shape default
interface.
 Further this module takes care of creating, deleting databases and representing
 them in the GUI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Persistence API
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module is responsible for entity management.
 It exposes a subset of JPA.
 By separating this module from the Database API it is possible to create
 a new databse on the fly, without any compile time knowledge about the
 database vendor, or the database structure.
 Besides the JPA this module exposes the 
\shape italic
org.jreserve.persistence.EntityRegistration 
\shape default
annotation.
 The annotated JPA entity classes are automaticly become managed entities,
 thus there is no need for an appart persistence unit in each module, which
 contains entities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Project System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module abstract the data structure within the application (very simmilar
 to the DataObject concept).
 It's most important class is the 
\shape italic

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

org.jreserve.project.system.ProjectElement 
\shape default
class.
 This class represents all business elements within the application (form
 a line of business to triangles, estimation methods etc).
 It provides basic functionality for loading, creating, saving, deleting,
 renaming and representing these elements in the GUI.
 The project elements are joind together in a tree structure.
 For extending modules it is easy to get a given child or insert a new child
 at an arbitrary location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Project API.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module provides the basic business entities, such as LoB (Like Motor,
 Fire), ClaimType (like CASCO, MTPL) and the Project class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data API
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module is responsible for managing the data specificaly used by estimations
 (claim data, earned premium, etc).
 It exposes a simple query object and hooks for importing data into the
 application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Triangle API
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module is responsible to provide easy access to data for the estimation
 methods.
 This module is currently under development.
 It will provide the tirangle and vector data structures as well as basic
 GUI elements for representing them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Estimation API
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module will be the extension point for the different estimation methods.
 It will provide the abstract 
\shape italic
org.jreserve.estimation.Estimation
\shape default
 class, as well as standard GUI elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bootstrap API
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module will be the extension point for the different bootstrap methods.
 It will provide the abstract 
\shape italic
org.jreserve.bootstrap.Bootstrap
\shape default
 class, as well as standard GUI elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other utilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some other, utility modules for example for logging, plotting
 or general settings.
